## 🚀 Getting Started

1️⃣ Make sure MongoDB is installed and running locally or connected to a cloud cluster (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).  
2️⃣ Open your MongoDB shell (mongosh) or use a MongoDB extension in VS Code.  
3️⃣ Connect to your database:
```bash
use plp_bookstore
db.createCollection("books");
queries run are in the queries.js file
